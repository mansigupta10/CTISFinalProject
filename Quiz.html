            Riding solo? Well don’t worry! We’ll help make your room your own
            personal oasis—one where you can escape the everyday struggles of college, study, or simply relax. You’ve
            got an advantage since you won’t have to worry about conflicts with a roommate. Keep in mind, however, that
            while you may have more space and privacy, all of the furnishings and essentials will need to be bought by
            you.

            So, you’re rooming with another person? Maybe a close friend, an acquaintance or even a complete stranger.
            No matter your circumstances, however, you’ll be living with another person which will be quite the new
            experience.
            Communication is key here. Make sure to talk with your other roomie about what their interests are and how
            they plan to decorate their side.

            People person? This is the room style that is the one for you! If you’ve chosen to live with multiple
            people, make sure that you have
            enough space and easily stored furniture to host game nights, movie nights, etc. With that many people,
            there’ll never
            be a dull moment! However, more people means more stuff, so make sure you coordinate and fund ample storage
            to keep everything organized and separated if necessary.
        </div>

        <div class="theresults" id="thecolor1">
            <h2 class="category" id="tipnumbers">Two</h2>
            You chose a warm color palette. Try finding some decor in red, yellow, or orange shades to bring a pop of
            color—for example, a white and orange bedding with some cute, yellow throw pillows.
        </div>
        <div class="theresults" id="thecolor2">
            <h2 class="category" id="tipnumbers">Two</h2>
            You chose a cool color palette. Try finding some decor in blue, green, or violet to bring in that feeling
            of cold, calm waters. For example, you could have blue bedding with some white throw pillows and a white
            throw blanket.

        </div>
        <div class="theresults" id="thecolor3">
            <h2 class="category" id="tipnumbers">Two</h2>
            You chose a neutral color palette, meaning you like a minimal look. Black, white, gray, and brown are the
            colors you
            should opt for. Since most of your colors are neutral, you could add an accent color to have a pop of color.
        </div>
        <div class="theresults" id="thecolor4">
            <h2 class="category" id="tipnumbers">Two</h2>
            You chose a bright color palette. Try and find 2 to 3 colors that are cohesive and can work well together.
            Try not to go overboard with how many colors you choose because that could end up looking messy. We would
            also suggest choosing a neutral color like white, black, or gray to go with your color scheme.

            Gotta go neutral with a few statement colors such as black, your school colors, or metallics
            like gold. Add some plants!!! Buy a vacuum!!!
        </div>
        <div class="theresults" id="thevibe2">
            <h2 class="category" id="tipnumbers">Three</h2>
            The boho vibe is definitely one of the cutest. Stock up on a few plants or succulents, or even
            buy a cute dreamcatcher! Some other options for decor would be some cute art pieces or a colorful tapestry.

        </div>
        <div class="theresults" id="thevibe3">
            <h2 class="category" id="tipnumbers">Three</h2>
            Choose one main color to make your room pop but keep the rest neutral, put up a bright tapestry that is a
            different color to create an accent wall since you can't paint your room. You could add some colorful decor
            or pictures to add an accent of color to the room.

        <div class="theresults" id="thevibe4">

            You definitely enjoy staying and reading a nice book or having a chill movie night with your
            friends/significant other.
            We would suggest buying some fairy lights to set the mood and a fluffy comforter/throw blanket.

        <div class="theresults" id="therug1">
            <h2 class="category" id="tipnumbers">Four</h2>
            You definitely like patterns and pops of color, so we would suggest buying decor that makes your room stand
            out.
            You can even opt for a fun-colored rug with stripes or a chevron pattern.

        </div>
        <div class="theresults" id="therug2">
            <h2 class="category" id="tipnumbers">Four</h2>
            You like to stick with the basics, so we would suggest buying a lot of neutral decor and accessories
            including a
            white or cream rug to add a nice, clean touch to the room. You could even buy a fluffy one to make it extra
            fun!

            <h2 class="category" id="tipnumbers">Four</h2>
            We noticed you enjoy some neutral and cool tones. We would suggest looking for some neutral decor to go
            along with your main accent color.
            You could consider buying a cool-toned rug as well could be a colorful, but not distracting touch to your
            room.

        <div class="theresults" id="therug4">
            <h2 class="category" id="tipnumbers">Four</h2>
            We noticed that you like subtle patterns that add a bit of character to your room but aren’t too
            distracting. We would suggest buying a neutral toned rug,
            whether it be gray, black, or white, with a simple pattern on it such as chevron or floral. You could match
            these tones with your bedding as well to tie it all together.

            You’re definitely on a tight budget. Some stores we recommend are Goodwill, Walmart, and various thrift
            shops.
            It is easy to find cute decor and dorm pieces at these places for a low price!

            You’re on a flexible budget, but you definitely want to save money. Don’t worry we know college is
            expensive!.
            Some stores we recommend are Target and Bed, Bath, and Beyond. While they can be a bit pricey, they are
            realistic and have a great selection of dorm decor.

            You are on a pretty flexible budget and want to have a cute room for college. Some stores we would recommend
            are Costco, Wayfair, and HomeGoods.
            They are definitely on the more expensive side, but they have a wide selection for dorm decor and dorm
            essentials.

            You are excited to decorate your dorm and your room is obviously a priority. Some stores we would suggest
            are Urban Outfitters,
            Dormify, DormCo, and Roomify. Their prices lie on the more pricey side, but it is definitely worth it. They
            have some cozy options that fit everyone’s style!

            School colors aren't everyone’s favorite and we understand that! Stick to your vibe and your color palette
            when picking your decor.

        <div class="theresults" id="thespirit2">
            <h2 class="category" id="tipnumbers">Six</h2>
            Maybe throw in a throw blanket or a few throw pillows that match your school’s colors. Another option could
            be adding a small banner or desk decor to add on your desk.
        </div>

            School pride is definitely important to you, so maybe throw in a tapestry with your school colors or add
            some wall decor that reflects your school or your school colors!

        </div>
        <div class="theresults" id="thespirit4">

            Since you love school pride and school spirit, this would be a chance to make your room’s theme based on
            your school colors. For example, if your school colors are blue and white, then have a blue and white
            bedspread, with some blue and white wall decor.

            You love color and are proud of your school! While you don’t have to overwhelm your room with school spirit,
            try to incorporate your school colors into some accent pieces to really highlight your pride.

            Greenery is a great way to bring your own style into a room! Not only are they great decoration pieces,
            they help filter the air (which is always a good thing in an older, stuffy dorm building).
            See if you can find a small plant to put on your desk or windowsill, or if your room is big enough, get a
            standing plant to put in a corner and add some height to the room!

            Got wanderlust? Desk and wall decor are great ways to showcase the adventures you’ve taken (or want to
            take)!
            Use maps, pictures, and souvenirs to give your room a personalized feel, and it’ll give you a chance to tell
            people about where you’ve been.

            Since dorms are small, make organization your main focus. This can include labels,
