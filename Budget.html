    <div class="budget">
        <l1>
            <h2><span class="number">1</span>Make a List!</h2>
        </l1>
        <p>Yes, I know this seems obvious, but the real key to this trick is sticking to your list. If you aren't sure
            you need to bring, check out our <strong id="essentials"><a href="Essentials.html">Essentials List</a></strong> to make sure you aren't
            forgetting anything! Then, as you walk through Target or HomeGoods collecting all of your necessities, make
            sure you leave that really cute succulent (because we all know you don't need a succulent, no matter how
            cute it is).</p>
    </div>
    <div class="budget" id="two">
        <l1>
            <h2><span class="number">2</span>Can you DIY?</h2>
        </l1>
        <p>You want your dorm to feel homey, but throw pillows and wall decor add up quickly. While there will be some
            things that will be nearly impossible to DIY without some serious skill, you'd be surprised how easy it is
            to sew a throw pillow or make a picture collage for your wall! See what you can do on your own before
            resorting to store-bought items.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="budget" id="three">
        <l1>
            <h2><span class="number">3</span>Talk with your roommate</h2>
        </l1>
        <p>Especially if you don't already know your roommate personally, it can seem a little awkward to start a
            conversation, but it will really help you! You don't need two microwaves or two rugs, and these mistakes can
            be very easily avoided with a quick discussion of who's bringing what.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="budget" id="four">
        <l1>
            <h2><span class="number">4</span>Wait until after move in</h2>
        </l1>
        <p>I know it's easy to get caught up in the excitement of moving out and creating a space from scratch, but it's
            really easy to overestimate the amount of space available to you. Go ahead and get your essentials, but wait
            until after you move-in and see what space you have before getting too many extras. And it could be a great
            activity for you and your new roommate to do together!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="budget" id="five">
        <l1>
            <h2><span class="number" id="last">5</span>Use your student discount</h2>
        </l1>
        <p>Another plus of waiting until after you move in, a lot of stores and online retailers offer discounts to
            students with their student ID. There are a ton of retailers that do this, so do your research and find some
            goods deals in your area.</p>
